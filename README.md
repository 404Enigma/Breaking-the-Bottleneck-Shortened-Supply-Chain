<h2>The Problem it Solves</h2>
To tackle the problem of shorter supply chains and to improve versatility and resilience, SupplyByte uses a machine-learning algorithm which is used to predict the sales of the products for the current month by calling out a private API made by us which basically consists of a machine learning algorithm. So, the algorithm's main task is to identify the relationship between the sales of the products of previous years considering data back from 2014 to the present month. After predicting the sales of the current month, it is used by the vendor to predict the amount of stock needed by him for that particular month. It then helps in building a strong supply chain system by directly keeping in contact with the supplier and the vendor.

Using SupplyByte, one can predict the sales of the future too using our API. By predicting the sales of the current month, our system surpasses the problem of the supply chain system.

SupplyByte also has a feature named "Emergency Need of Stock" which is available to the vendor in case of need of emergency stock. It can be used when there is a sudden increase in the demand for a particular product which forces the supplier to increase the supply of that respective product to avoid the sudden break in the supply chain system. When the user needs the stock in case of emergency, SupplyByte smartly finds the fastest and the most convenient path out to reach out to the user choosing from various suppliers irrespective of the distance between them shown in the form of Google Maps. So basically our algorithm predicts that they follow the most efficient and least congested way out to reach the destination. SupplyByte also ensures that the supplier which is selected, manages the best availability to facilities in terms of stock, availability, transportation etc.

Secondly, to tackle the problem of the shortened and diversified supply chains to provide better traceability and assurances of authenticity, SupplyByte has a platform for its customers and vendors to know about various suppliers which are available and how they are different from each other in terms of price, stock, rating by the customers, distance etc. A platform built where a customer or a vender have a choice to add a particular item to its cart of future references. SupplyByte helps the customer/vendor to know about the best supplier available to them so that they can choose wisely and buy the much better deal.
